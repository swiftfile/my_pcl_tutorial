-- Could NOT find pcl_conversions (missing: pcl_conversions_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'pcl_conversions'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_conversions"
  with any of the following names:

    pcl_conversionsConfig.cmake
    pcl_conversions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pcl_conversions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "pcl_conversions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "pcl_conversions" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
